# Spark Streaming project for ID2221 data intensive computing
## Dependency
Spark version 3.3.0

Scala version 2.12.15
## Description
An e-commerce company can analyze which products have received the most attention during this period based on how many times a product has been clicked, how long the user has stayed, and whether the user has favorited the product. It is also possible to recommend products to users based on this data. Spark Streaming and Kafka will be used to build a real-time data processing system to calculate which products are currently the most popular on the e-commerce platform. And finally the data will be stored in a HDFS.  
## Data
The real-time data comes from a simulation computer program. The data includes the products customers are currently browsing, as well as the number of times they have browsed the products and how long they have stayed there, and whether they have favorited the products.
